    "The data set being used contains research paper titles and abstracts as well as labels as either Computer Science, Physics, Mathematics, Statistics, Quantitative Biology, Quantitative Finance, or some combination of those labels.  The approach that I am taking is to convert the text to a vector using word embeddings trained on this data set, then I will train a classifier for each of the labels, separately.  At the end I am going to create a function that when text is inputed will return the likely topic(s) of the title or abstract.\n",

    "While this ensemble classifier does not work perfectly, it does a fairly descent job of classifying the papers correctly. With the way thes models have been trained, it seems that the title gives more of an indication of the field of the paper, rather than the abstract.  Having thought about this a bit, I think maybe the abstract classifiers would be more accurate if the window of the word embeddings for them was larger, since the abstracts have more words, and so maybe a context longer than 5 words.  However, overall the accuracy of 80%+ test and training accuracy for the the titles is a good indication that this classification can be done well.  I am sure it is possible to improve the accuracy a bit.  I believe a better method of combining the word embeddings, instead of a simple average as I have done here, might achieve greater accuracy."
